Clone from wherever you are reading this.

    git clone <whatever>

Then install the gems necessary to do stuff.

    bundle install

If you don't have an appropriate Ruby installed, it'll yell at you. It's
probably easiest to do something like this if you haven't previously done it:

    curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    rvm install `cat .ruby-version`

Or, if you already have RVM installed and it yells at you, literally execute:

    $rvm_recommended_ruby

Tab completion is your friend on that one.

    jekyll serve --watch

Open your browser and go to http://localhost:4000.

To start a new post, use `poole`:

    poole draft "Your post name"

This will create the file `_drafts/your_post_name.md`. Edit that file to your
heart's content, then commit and submit the PR. When we're ready to publish the
post, you can do `poole publish your_post_name` or 
`poole publish _drafts/your_post_name.md` to move it to the `_posts` directory.
Submit another PR and it'll go live as soon as someone with commit bit and
Heroku access puts it up.

If your post has images, put the images in a directory within `images/posts` that
bears the same name as the post's slug. That is, the filename that `poole`
generates without the extension. Make sure that you put `{:.img}` on the line
*before* a line that just has an image, so that the image will be centered.

you are deserving of such.
