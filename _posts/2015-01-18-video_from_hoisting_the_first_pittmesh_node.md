We found [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MGPBH8svJ0) we forgot we
posted from when we strapped our very first [PittMesh](http://www.pittmesh.net)
node at [HackPittsburgh](http://www.hackpittsburgh.org/) in April 2013.

We have since changed the configuration there, but it is a fun taste of the early
days of Meta Mesh and PittMesh.
