Today we decided to stop our Kickstarter campaign. In the past few weeks, Meta Mesh and its volunteers have had to face a lot of challenges, both in the business and personal realms. We received wide support from many of those we directly asked-- and for that we are terrifically grateful. 

We have decided to change the direction our company is headed. In no way are we finished. In fact this Kickstarter experience revealed a lot to us about who we want to be and how to be it. 

In the upcoming months we will be expanding PittMesh, launching a webstore where pre-configured routers can be purchased, and will be building a dedicated PittMesh Working Group where people who want to contribute to building a Community Wireless Network can learn about new technology can gain new skills, and can network with inspired people.

Definitely stay tuned to our website and our social media feeds. In fact, mere moments after closing our Kickstarter campaign something occurred which we will announce shortly that has been months in the making and we are incredibly excited about. We’re not done. No way. As they say, it’s hard to keep a good man down. We’ll be in touch with you all again shortly.

Stay tuned.
