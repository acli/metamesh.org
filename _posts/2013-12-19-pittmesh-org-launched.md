Today, [META MESH](http://metamesh.org) officially launched the web site for its
premiere project, [PittMesh.net](http://pittmesh.net). This work is the result of
several hours of hard development work!

The site features a styled map that will eventually be a map of all PittMesh
nodes. The rest of the site will be built out as needed, but expect awesome stuff
in 2014!

PittMesh is Pittsburgh's community-owned and maintained wireless network. META 
MESH is the primary sponsor of the network.

**Update 2014-12-23:** We moved it to PittMesh.*net*, because, well, PittMesh is a network, *right?*
