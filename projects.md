## Ongoing Projects

**[PittMesh](http://pittmesh.net)** is a community wireless mesh project. Our
[informational video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvAT7DTspaM) explains the
wireless mesh networking and what we hope to achieve with it in Pittsburgh.

#### PittMesh Seed Networks

Seed networks are spurred by grants or generous residents who want to accelerate
growth of PittMesh in specific areas of the city. While some of these seed
networks may be isolated from PittMesh, once online, we actively seek to connect
an isolated network to the main network somehow.

[Wireless Warrington](/blog/2014/10/05/wireless_warrington_begins) is a part of
PittMesh that was funded by a grant from the [Urban Redevelopment Authority of
Pittsburgh](http://www.ura.org/) facilitated by the [Mount Washington Community
Development Corporation](http://mwcdc.org/). This network has joined the main
network.

[PittMesh: Morningside](#) is a network currently in planning stages. Parties
interested in hosting a node [should fill out this
