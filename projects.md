## Ongoing Projects

**[PittMesh](http://pittmesh.net)** is a community wireless mesh project. Our
[informational video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvAT7DTspaM) explains the
wireless mesh networking and what we hope to achieve with it in Pittsburgh.

[Wireless Warrington](/blog/2014/10/05/wireless_warrington_begins) is a part of 
PittMesh that was funded by a grant from the [Urban Redevelopment Authority of 
Pittsburgh](http://www.ura.org/) facilitated by the [Mount Washington Community
Development Corporation](http://mwcdc.org/).


## In Development
