title: Brewing up wifi at the Brew House in the South Side Flats

Meta Mesh is proud to announce our highest-visibility node yet! 10 stories above the streets of the South Side are 
four new antennas broadcasting the PittMesh network for all to use! This 5 GHz backhaul node is not connected to the
Internet and does not yet enable access to any services. Instead, it acts as a central point toward which thousands of Pittsburgh residents
can point an antenna and get connected to the same network. What this means is that someone living on 8th Street 
can use a wireless router running the Commotion firmware and a directional antenna pointed to the roof of the 
Brew House apartments to connect to a friend or coworker on 24th Street who has set up similar wireless equipment. 

Where is the Brew House? It's behind the building with the nation's largest outdoor clockface. Unfortunately, the 
South Side clock obfuscates the node to some parts of the South Side: those parts will not have line-of-site to the
antennas. Please see the below heatmap of where you are able to receive a signal from the Brew House node.

The addition of the Brew House node expands PittMesh's availability from a few dozen Pittsburgh residents to a few 
thousand. We now have the seed in the South Side to begin building a true wireless mesh Metropolitan Area Network!
