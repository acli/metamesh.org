Ten stories above the South Side, four huge WiFi antennas are perched in their new roost. Meta Mesh is overjoyed to announce the completion of its most ambitious installation yet: four 19 dbi, 120 degree sector antennas providing the South Side Slopes and Flats with a 5 GHz ad hoc backhaul network. Proudly proclaiming the SSID of “PittMesh_Backhaul”, they are meshed together via a gigabit power-over-Ethernet switch and now serve one of Pittsburgh’s most unique neighborhoods with a central connection point for PittMesh, Pittsburgh’s most unique wireless network.

These four wireless access points do not serve as an Internet gateway. Instead, they acts as a central point through which residents can connect by aiming directional antennas at that are attached to their wireless access points or WiFi cards. So if you’re on 8th Street and want to connect to your friend on 24th, just point your 5 GHz antennas at the top of the Brew House behind the famous South Side clock tower to connect. The Brew House nodes produce an ad hoc mode connection--not the more common Client Mode type that is used in WiFi hotspots so your smart phone, tablet, or laptop may not be able to see it as it is meant for OLSR-enabled routers.

Ideally, connected nodes use a wireless router running Commotion Wireless firmware (obtainable from www.commotionwireless.net) which is based on OpenWRT. You can, however, connect with any router running the OLSR network protocol for basic functionality.

Where is the Brew House? It's behind the building with the nation's largest outdoor clock face on the corner of 21st and Mary in the Flats. Unfortunately, the South Side clock building obfuscates the node to some parts of the South Side. Please see the map below of the estimated coverage area.

If you are a technologist in the South Side who has always wanted a network to play on outside of the Internet, here is your opportunity! To learn more about this unique, standalone network, find us on IRC’s Freenode network in the #PittMesh channel.

The addition of the Brew House node expands PittMesh's availability from a few dozen Pittsburgh residents to a few thousand. We now have the seed in the South Side to begin building a massive wireless Metropolitan Area Network! Please contact us if you are interested in hosting a node and we will be happy to assist you!

If you have any questions about PittMesh, compatibility, or are interested in hosting a node or service on the network, feel free to send us an e-mail at Info@metamesh.org. Keep your ears open for more upcoming announcements. We have a lot of really great things happening soon!
