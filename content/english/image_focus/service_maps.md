page_title: Every1online Service Coverage Maps
page_blurb: "<p><strong>Below are the coverage maps that Meta Mesh uses to determine
  if a house can receive signal from one of our towers. </strong></p><p><strong>Green</strong>:
  High probability of coverage</p><p><strong>Yellow</strong>: Possibility of coverage
  (needs resident participation to confirm). Yellow areas require more information
  to find out if they can get service. Images taken from the house (pointed toward
  the tower location) will be needed to see if the signal can reach the location.
  Images will be taken from the exterior of the house. We are exploring the most efficient
  ways to help people in the yellow areas assess their homes' connectivity potential
  quickly and easily. We will share updates on this process, and we invite those who
  are in a yellow (or even green!) area to reach out to us to learn more.</p><p><strong>Red</strong>:
  Confirmed no coverage area. If your home is within the Red coverage area, it is
  unlikely that service will reach your home in this first phase of the project. But,
  if you sign-up, we may be able to reach your home in a later phase of the program.</p><p><strong>Boundary</strong>:
  Limit of WiFi service area ends at the edge of the map image. If your home is near
  or on the boundary, please submit your information to determine if service reaches
  the location.</p>"
