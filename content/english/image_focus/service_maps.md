page_blurb: "<p>These are our current coverage maps.<br><br>Green: High probability
  of coverage.<br><br>Yellow: Possible coverage. Yellow areas need more information!
  Images taken from outside the house (pointed toward the tower location) tell us
  if the signal can reach. We are exploring the most efficient ways to help people
  in the yellow areas assess their homes' connectivity potential quickly and easily.
  We will share updates on this process, and we invite those who are in a yellow (or
  even green!) area to reach out to us to learn more.<br><br>Red: Confirmed no coverage
  area. If your home is within the Red coverage area, it is unlikely that service
  will reach your home in this first phase of the project. But if you sign-up, we'll
  notify you when you are covered.<br><br>Boundary: Limit of WiFi service area ends
  at the edge of the map image. If your home is near or on the boundary, please submit
  your information to determine if service reaches the location.</p>"
