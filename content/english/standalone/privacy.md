# Our Privacy Statement

This policy adapted from the Automattic privacy policy and is available under a[ Creative Commons Sharealike license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Meta Mesh Wireless Communities (“MMWC”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Statement of Privacy applies to MMWC’s Networking Services and the MMWC website; it governs data collection and usage. By using the MMWC website or receiving MMWC services, you consent to the data practices described in this statement.

# Collection of your Personal Information: Website Users

Like most website operators, the MMWC website collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. MMWC's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how MMWC’s visitors use its website.

MMWC encourages you to review the privacy statements of any website you choose to visit, through our networking services or through other means, so that you can understand how those websites collect, use and share your information.

## Map Terms of Service

The MMWC website may provide maps showing areas of service or other past, present, or planned network features.

The data backing these map services is subject to change at any time and may be out of date or may represent planned changes not yet effected.

Access to the endpoints providing the data is on an as-is basis and may cease to function or its availability limited at any time.

Do not build critical services that rely on the endpoints or their data without entering into a service level agreement with MMWC.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. MMWC uses cookies to help MMWC identify and track visitors, their usage of the MMWC website, and their website access preferences. MMWC visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using MMWC's websites, with the drawback that certain features of MMWC's websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.

## Third-Party Services

The MMWC website may employ Third-Party Services to aid in visitor tracking, advertising campaign tracking, and other website functionality. Core website functionality, ads, or social media content appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by third-party service partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow these services to recognize your computer each time they provide their service to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows services to, among other things, deliver targeted services that they believe will be of most interest to you.

This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by MMWC and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Contact third-party service providers or visit their website to receive their privacy policy.

# Use of your Personal Information: Website Users

MMWC collects and uses your personal information to deliver Internet-based services you have requested. MMWC may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or services available from MMWC. MMWC may also contact you via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that may be offered.

MMWC does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.

## Aggregated Statistics

MMWC may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites or users of its services. MMWC may display the aggregated and anonymized information publicly or provide it to third-party service providers or other partners.

# Business Transfers

If MMWC, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that MMWC goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any successor or acquirer of MMWC’s business may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

# Changes to this Statement

Although most changes are likely to be minor, MMWC may change this Privacy Policy without notice from time to time, and at MMWC’s sole discretion. MMWC encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.

Policy last updated 2020-08-27.

# Contact Information

MMWC takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction of personally-identifying and potentially personally-identifying information.
