Hello!  
We have received your sign-up information for Every1online, a residential WiFi pilot program. Construction for this project is well underway. We will be in touch with you in the next 3 weeks to move forward with the coverage assessment, where we cross-check your address with available service areas. Once confirmed, we can initiate the home installation phase.  
We appreciate your patience and thank you for your interest in Every1online!  
Best,  
The Meta Mesh Team
