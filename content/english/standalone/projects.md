Meta Mesh Wireless Communities is proud to announce our In-Home WiFi pilot project: _Internet Access for Distanced Learning in Three In-need Pittsburgh Communities: Homewood, Coraopolis, and New Kensington._ 

The purpose of this project is to bridge Pittsburgh’s Digital Divide by deploying a community-based, non-profit Wireless Internet Service Provider (WISP). This WISP is a collaborative effort that taps on existing resources and strategic community partners to provide the _last mile solution_: getting internet into the homes of Pittsburghers who need it most. 

This Pilot Project is the first iteration of a network design that will service households in New Kensington, Coraopolis, and Homewood. The Pilot Project prioritizes households with students who require internet access for distance learning, and will provide 12 months of In-Home WiFi at no charge to participating households.This Pilot Project is the first iteration of a network design that will service households in New Kensington, Coraopolis, and Homewood.

Our network to get Internet access to the areas of New Kensington-Arnold School District, Cornell School District, and Homewood School District. 

**Carnegie Mellon University:** A team of collaborators from CMU’s School of Computer Science and the Simon Initiative have coordinated the project connections to CMU and Pitt, provided critical start-up funding for the project and liaise to key stakeholders and community groups. They offer ongoing project design, implementation, and fundraising support.

· **University of Pittsburgh**: Pitt IT, the CIO Office, and Community & Governmental Relations are Key Stakeholders and Integral Collaborators contributing facility access and funding to enable use of the Cathedral of Learning as the “Super Node/hub.” They will support stakeholder and community involvement in additional neighborhoods following the pilot.

· **The Keystone Initiative for Network Based Education and Research (KINBER):** KINBER is a vendor partner to both CMU and Pitt and will provide “gateway” to the internet through PennREN Fiber, to be broadcasted from the Cathedral of Learning.

· **Participating School Districts and Community Groups**: The **New Kensington-Arnold** **school district** and **Cornell (Coraopolis)** **school districts**, as well as the **Homewood Children's Village** are collaborators in this pilot project. They bring vital expertise to this project, leading the effort to build community buy-in, leveraging social capital to facilitate the creation of WISP infrastructure, and identifying households in need of internet connectivity. They also advise CMU, Pitt, and Meta Mesh partners on community need and intentional partnership practices.
