As a nonprofit, there are three main ways that we can continue to provide deeply needed Internet services to underserved communities for a low cost:

1. We write grant proposals, and if they are accepted, we receive funds for our projects.
2. We depend on the enthusiasm of our volunteers, who help us in many different ways. Some help us with installation of our equipment, some with programming or Linux administration help us maintain the network, and others help with general administrative tasks. If you would like to assist us as a volunteer, please fill out our volunteer form!
3. We utilize donations to fund operational costs. If you would like to contribute directly to our efforts, please consider making a donation!

We are humbled by your interest in our mission, and we are grateful for support in any form. Another important way to help is to simply spread the word -- be that by telling your network of friends/families/colleagues about our work, or sharing a link to our site from your social media. Every bit helps!
