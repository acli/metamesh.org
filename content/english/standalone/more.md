# Additional Reading

We strive to be transparent by ensuring that any member of the public, regardless of their base knowledge of WiFi technologies, can understand our mission. That’s why we created a glossary of terms, an FAQ page, and a list of technical resources available on this website.

Please contact us if you have any questions or recommendations for improving the accessibility of our resources.

## Glossary

We created this glossary to ensure that anyone, regardless of their previous knowledge of WiFi technology, can use it to get an understanding of WiFi lingo. Terms are defined and put into the context of Meta Mesh’s operations. This list is by no means exhaustive — we are continually updating this resource to make “tech talk” more clear. If there is a term in our materials that you wish was defined more clearly, please contact us and let us know!

###### How do the speeds of different kinds of networks compare?

> _"The Federal Communications Commissions defines 25 megabits per second as broadband access. Slower speeds can mean extended time downloading information or images from the internet, making research difficult for students and reducing the quality of Netflix movies."_
