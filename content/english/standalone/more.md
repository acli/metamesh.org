# Additional Reading

We strive to be transparent by ensuring that any member of the public, regardless of their base knowledge of WiFi technologies, can understand our mission. That’s why we created a glossary of terms, an FAQ page, and a list of technical resources available on this website.

Please contact us if you have any questions or recommendations for improving the accessibility of our resources.

## Glossary

We created this glossary to ensure that anyone, regardless of their previous knowledge of WiFi technology, can use it to get an understanding of WiFi lingo. Terms are defined and put into the context of Meta Mesh’s operations. This list is by no means exhaustive — we are continually updating this resource to make “tech talk” more clear. If there is a term in our materials that you wish was defined more clearly, please contact us and let us know!

Access Points (APs)
: No definition available

Bandwidth
: Bandwidth refers to the maximum amount of data that can be transferred via internet connection within a certain timeframe. This is calculated as megabits per second (Mbps).

Broadband
: Broadband is used to describe faster internet that is always on (as compared to Dial-up access, which is slower). Meta Mesh uses Wireless Broadband Connections, which you can read more about [here](https://www.fcc.gov/general/types-broadband-connections#wireless).

Cell-Tower-Based-WiFi Hotspot
: Our WiFi Wagon Kits are equipped with Cell-Tower-Based-WiFi Hotspot technology that can connect any area (no matter how far) to the Internet. These kits are conveniently mobile and can be driven to wherever they are needed.

Community Wireless Networks
: The Meta Mesh Network is a Community Wireless Network because it operates through radio waves (rather than landlines), and we serve a specific community (City of Pittsburgh/Allegheny County).

Customer-Premises Equipment (CPEs)
: Although we don’t consider our network users “customers” because we are a non-profit organization, you may see this term used on the Meta Mesh Technical Resources page. For our purposes, it simply refers to the access points and in-home WiFi equipment (such as routers) that are placed inside or outside of residents’ homes.

Digital Divide
: The Digital Divide is a concept used to describe the gap in telecommunications access between different socio-economic groups. We have identified neighborhoods in the Pittsburgh area that have lower than average connectivity rates per household. We focus our projects on these underserved areas. Given the wide-spread effects of the COVID-19 Crisis, there is an increase in the number of Pittsburghers who need reliable access to the internet.

High Point Location
: When we construct radio towers, or request to put equipment on top of existing structures, we look for locations that are high up (i.e. on top of a hill) to get a clear line of sight to other towers. Meta Mesh has to strategically select High Point Locations to avoid connection interruptions because we use radio waves instead of ethernet cables.

Line of Sight
: We use the term “Line of Sight” to describe the strength of the connection between towers and routers. If you can “see” one tower from the top of another, that means there are no physical disruptions between the two sites.

High Foliage
: High Foliage refers to areas that have physical barriers that can interrupt the connection between towers and routers. These barriers may include treetops, buildings, or other intruding objects.

HTTP

HTTPS
: No definition available

Indoor Networking
: In the Cathedral of Learning Supernode design, the four HD PtMP Sector Antennas will be connected to the PennREN network through wiring inside the building (Indoor Networking). The Indoor Networking materials in this case include a Switch, Router, UPS, and the PennRen fiber cable.

IP
: IP stands for the “Internet Protocol” used to communicate over a network. It refers to the hierarchy of stages that delivers packets of data from one host to another.

IP Address
: The IP Address is a specific numeric name for every Internet using device. Every computer has a different IP Address.

ISP
: ISP stands for “Internet Service Provider.”

KINBER
: [KINBER (Keystone Initiative for Network Based Education)](https://kinber.org) provides network-based connectivity and services across Pennsylvania. They provide Meta Mesh with a connection to the Internet, and we distribute that access locally in Pittsburgh.

LTU Equipment
: LTU Equipment is the name of a line of PtMP networking devices that Meta Mesh buys from Ubiquity.

Maker Space
: No definition available

Mast
: In the Cathedral of Learning Supernode design, the four HD PtMP Sector Antennas are each secured to a mast that allows Meta Mesh to adjust the height and directionality of the antennas.

Mpbs
: Mpbs stands for Megabits per second used to the rate (or “speed”) at which data can be transferred across a network.

PenREN Fiber
: PennREN is the name of KINBER’s file optic network spanning across Pennsylvania. Meta Mesh connects to PennREN through a cable that is inside the Cathedral of Learning. Meta Mesh then projects that connection to other areas of Pittsburgh through High Definition Sector Antennas.

PittMesh
: PittMesh was the original name of The Meta Mesh Wireless Network.

: UBNT is an acronym for the company [Ubiquity Networks](https://www.ui.com), which is where Meta Mesh sources all the hardware needed to support the network (antennas, access points, etc.)

UPS
: UPS stands for “Unlimited Power Supply.” In the Cathedral of Learning Supernode design, the Indoor Networking plans include a connection to the building’s Unlimited Power Supply of electricity to power the antennas.

###### Why would I choose a mesh/WISP structure rather than telecom provided internet?

Check out [this flyer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18bi9M0zQGHv3DZgx3uXPMUD--TEUzGsr/view?usp=sharing "Mesh vs Telecom") for more information!

###### How do the speeds of different kinds of networks compare?

> _"The Federal Communications Commissions defines 25 megabits per second as broadband access. Slower speeds can mean extended time downloading information or images from the internet, making research difficult for students and reducing the quality of Netflix movies."_
