# Contact Us

Do you want to help build [PittMesh](http://www.pittmesh.net)? Let us know.

## IRC

We maintain an [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel on
FreeNode: [irc://irc.freenode.net:6667/pittmesh](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=pittmesh).

## Conduct

We adhere to a [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/pittmesh/governance/blob/master/code-of-conduct.markdown)
that governs how we interact with each other and our community.

## Mailing list

Our mailing list traffic is pretty low, and is only used for major announcements.

## Donations

While we prefer to help interested people set up nodes to connect to [PittMesh](http://www.pittmesh.net), we
also accept donations to drive our rollout.

### Hardware

We accept donated hardware.

For routers, our primary requirement is that routers are able to run OSLRd. For
the most part, this means that we want
[routers that can run OpenWRT](http://wiki.openwrt.org/toh/start) or
[routers that can run DD-WRT](http://dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices).
If the router you want to donate is on either of those lists as supported, then
we can put it to good use! If it is not on that list, and your other option is to
discard it, we will happily take it anyway,
[donating it to Goodwill](http://www.goodwillswpa.org/computer-store)
if we cannot use it.

For spare computers, we are in need of rack servers, 1U or 2U, that were
manufactured in the last five years.

We could also use antennas, antenna mounting equipment, spare Ethernet cabling,
and other miscellaneous items. Let us know!

### Funding

Our preferred donation method is Bitcoin. Our anonymous donation address is
[1meshQDzpXUQJSdNVH7BujkudqfatFxnq](bitcoin:1meshQDzpXUQJSdNVH7BujkudqfatFxnq){:.coin}
but consider sending us a message so that we can credit you somehow for your
generousity. We also accept [Dogecoin](dogecoin:DMMx3mSt5swBqQZEwtw3haYmMoLwmSP3zj){:.coin}
and [Litecoin](litecoin:LMMQQNHT172pK6Ys9u64fFbodHtHGWJHBX){:.coin}.
Otherwise, we accept WePay and can take credit
cards directly via Square. Contact us for more information on those and other
donation methods, including other cryptocurrencies.

Additionally, you can [donate directly to Meta Mesh agents via Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/MetaMeshLLC). Donations on Gratipay are divided among those active in our organization according to each person's activity.

META MESH is a for-profit, but bootstrapped company the beneficial community
focus of which may lead the average person to believe that it is a non-profit.
Unfortunately, donations to META MESH are *not tax deductible*.

## Other stuff

Do you have time and skills you can donate? Or perhaps a rooftop with a sturdy
chimney or other place to mount an antenna or three? Let us know.
