META MESH is a for-profit, but bootstrapped company the beneficial community
focus of which may lead the average person to believe that it is a non-profit.
Unfortunately, donations to META MESH are *not tax deductible*. That doesn't mean we made this company to line our pockets.
We have a mission of propogating wireless mesh networks for community use and donations will go toward that mission.
