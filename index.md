title: META MESH | Building the next Internet
---
# META MESH is building a wireless mesh network in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

**What is a mesh network?** Most of us have a home Internet connection to an
Internet Service Provider (ISP) such as Verizon or Comcast. To communicate with
each other, all our network traffic must go through these ISPs &mdash; even if
the person to whom we are sending an e-mail lives across the street. This
centralized way of networking presents many security and privacy problems.

A *mesh network* cuts out that centralized middleman. Instead of traffic having
to go to a big server hundreds of miles away, a mesh network's traffic is routed
by the shortest and fastest possible path.

Meta Mesh has two primary goals. 

First, to make building these mesh networks simple
enough that non-technical people can accomplish this task. This means writing 
documentation, streamlining solutions, and educating people so that they can build
their own networks without the need for an IT company. ISP's, while essential for
national and international communication, end up forcing regular people to lease their
ability to communicate with each other. If we can empower communities
to build their own networks and add services on those networks, we can literally give a
voice to those who are not serviced by ISPs due to cost, lack of ISP infrastructure, or 
for any other reason preventing easy, ubiquitous Internet access.

Second, to build a proof-of-concept network in our hometown of Pittsburgh called PittMesh.
PittMesh serves as an example of how to build a mesh network in a specific geographic area
that has websites and services built into the network. PittMesh is a standalone wireless 
network that exists parallel to the Internet and will remain up should Internet access go down.
Meta Mesh does not own PittMesh; users and node hosts own PittMesh. And while Meta Mesh 
offers services on the network, it has no mandatory centralized control over it.

[**PittMesh**](http://pittmesh.net) is a network of routers connected wirelessly. 
Meta Mesh uses only consumer-grade, off-the-shelf Wi-Fi hardware
available at any electronics store or easily online. When you use the PittMesh Network, you not
only gain access to all the resources and anonymity that an "off-the-grid"
network affords, but you expand the network, allowing others to connect and
expand the network even further. To see the location of live nodes in your area, check out
