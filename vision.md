#Vision

Meta Mesh takes mesh networking technology and ideas from around the world and
implements them in a way that makes mesh networking accessible to anyone,
regardless of their technical abilities.

Our company envisions a regional network of inexpensive Wi-Fi nodes
owned by and placed on or in residences and small businesses, creating a
shared network that is open, secure, anonymous, and free to use.

[PittMesh's](http://www.pittmesh.net) multitude of owners, unlike regular ISPs' networks, means that the network has no central points of
failure. As long as nodes are powered, no ISP, terrorist organization, weather
event, hacker, or government institution can disrupt the entire [PittMesh](http://www.pittmesh.net)
network.
